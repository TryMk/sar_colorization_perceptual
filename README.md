# GAN-Based Re-colorization of SAR Grayscale Images

This repository contains the implementation and results of a project focused on the re-colorization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) grayscale images using a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). This project leverages a conditional GAN (cGAN) architecture trained on paired optical and SAR data to reconstruct colorized versions of SAR images.

## üåü Project Objectives

- Translate grayscale SAR images into realistic RGB representations.
- Utilize GANs to learn the complex mapping between SAR and optical domains.
- Evaluate and compare results with traditional and other deep learning methods.

## üß† Architecture Overview

### Generator Architecture

![Generator Architecture](images/generator_architecture.png)

The generator uses an encoder-decoder network with skip connections (similar to U-Net) to translate SAR inputs into RGB outputs.

### Discriminator Architecture

![Discriminator Architecture](images/discriminator_architecture.png)

The discriminator is a CNN that evaluates whether the generated image is realistic, conditioned on the SAR input.

## üîç Dataset

- Source: Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (Optical) satellite images.
- Preprocessing steps included:
  - Patch extraction (128√ó128)
  - Min-max normalization
  - Data augmentation (flipping and rotation)

## üèãÔ∏è Training Details

- Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
- Loss Function: Conditional GAN loss + L1 Loss
- Optimizer: Adam
- Epochs: 100
- Batch Size: 16
- Evaluation Metrics: PSNR, SSIM, RMSE, UQI, ERGAS
